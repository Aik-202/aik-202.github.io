## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS media queries
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
- I've always built my webpages using CSS Flex-box, but i decided to give CSS grid a chance, so in this project i learnt how to use CSS grid, it was pretty strange at first, but i got use to it and was able to get comfortable with it. 
- I also learnt a few JavaScript regular expressions like /\d/,/[a-zA-z]/, /[0-9]/, which i used to test the type of value the user entered. 
- I also learnt some JavaScript events that I have not used before, like the onfocusout, onmouseout and oninput

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I really love to continue learning about JavaScript regular expressions and about other JavaScript events, and also use more of CSS grid

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - Helped me learn about CSS grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. It also helped me understand some JavaScript events
- [Example resource 2](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-check-if-string-contains-numbers) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand regular expressions in JavaScript. I'd recommend it to anyone, its very good in identifying type of values in a string .
